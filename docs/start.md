Welcome to OwnDroid docs

## Before you start

1. Profile owner and Device owner have very high privilege, use with caution
2. All commands should be run in `adb shell` environment. Please enter ADB shell first, do not `adb shell xxx`

::: info

There are some TODOs in the docs. Don't care them. They're for the developer's use.

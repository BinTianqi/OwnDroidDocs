## Wi-Fi SSID policy

**[API33]**

Wi-Fi SSID policy specifies the SSID restriction the network must satisfy in order to be eligible for a connection.

Modes:

- None
- Blacklist
- Whitelist

## Private DNS

**[Device owner]**

**[API29]**

You can set private DNS mode to auto

### Sets the Private DNS mode to opportunistic

In this mode, the DNS subsystem will attempt a TLS handshake to the network-supplied resolver prior to attempting name resolution in cleartext.

### Sets the Private DNS host

It will perform a connectivity check to the resolver, to ensure it is valid.

In case a VPN is used in conjunction with Private DNS resolver, the Private DNS resolver must be reachable both from within and outside the VPN. Otherwise, the device may lose the ability to resolve hostnames as system traffic to the resolver may not go through the VPN.

TODO: update strings (opportunistic), set host in coroutine
